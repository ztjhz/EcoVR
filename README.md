## The Vision

Ecosystem simulations are powerful tools for understanding ecological complexities. VR enhances these simulations, making abstract concepts tangible and engaging. While various simulations exist, EcoVR specifically addresses the gap in VR-based tools designed for observing and analyzing **animal interactions within forest ecosystems**.

This project explores the benefits of VR simulations for ecological education and research, introducing EcoVR as an immersive tool demonstrating this potential.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **üå≤ Immersive Forest Environment:** Explore a rich, stylized forest setting built with high-quality assets.
* **ü¶Ö Dual View Modes:**
    * **Bird's Eye View:** Observe the entire ecosystem, spawn animals, control weather, adjust time speed, and zoom. Includes an interactive tutorial for new users.
    * **First-Person View:** Experience the forest at ground level, move freely, use tools, and interact directly with animals using intuitive gestures.
* **üß† Intelligent Animal Agents:**
    * **Predator-Prey Dynamics:** Witness autonomous predators (Wolves) hunting prey (Sheep, Goats) using Finite State Machine (FSM) based AI. *(FSM diagrams pending)*
    * **Evasive Behaviours:** Prey actively detect and flee from nearby predators.
* **üß¨ Realistic Population Dynamics:**
    * **Natural Birth/Death:** Population controls inspired by Conway's Game of Life principles, considering loneliness (underpopulation) and competition (overpopulation).
    * **Hunger & Hydration:** Animals possess needs that deplete over time, influenced by actions (hunting, foraging) and weather, potentially leading to starvation or dehydration.
* **‚òÄÔ∏è Dynamic Weather & Time System:** Experience Sunny, Stormy, Foggy, Snowy conditions, and Day/Night cycles, all impacting animal behaviour, detection ranges, speed, and survival needs (powered by Tenkoku Dynamic Sky).
* **üõ†Ô∏è Interactive Tools & Actions:**
    * **Binoculars & Magnifying Glass:** Observe animals up close or from afar using realistic render-texture based tools.
    * **Feeding & Watering:** Directly provide food and water to influence animal hunger/hydration levels.
    * **Detection Radius Visualisation:** Toggleable overlays (Red for predators, Blue for prey) to understand animal perception ranges.
* **üìä In-Depth Analytics Lab:**
    * Step into a futuristic research pod environment to visualize simulation data.
    * Track animal counts, population trends over time, spatial distribution heatmaps, compare species attributes (radar charts), and view population forecasts (ARIMA model). Powered by XCharts.
